<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>AN
ANSWER<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
<i>APPEAL of JOHN CHURCH</i>,<br />
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something so ungenerous in
assailing a fallen foe&mdash;something so outrageous to
humanity&mdash;that nothing but an imperative and paramount sense
of duty to the public, could induce the Publishers of the
following details, to notice the contents of &ldquo;an Appeal to
the Candid Public,&rdquo; by John Church.&nbsp; Unfortunately for
him, unfortunately for the practice he has espoused, his own
account is sufficient to condemn him; so that it might justly be
said of him&mdash;&ldquo;Out of thine own mouth I judge thee,
thou worker of Iniquity!&rdquo;&nbsp; What, indeed, do his
exculpations mean?&nbsp; Every where he intimates his proneness
to the hateful and unpardonable sin of backsliding.&nbsp; But
still he backslides in his sleep.&nbsp; Unknowing
transgressor!&nbsp; What would society say of that female, who,
acknowledging that she had been seduced, should pretend that her
seduction was effected in her sleep?</p>
<p>Professors like Church are the bane of christianity.&nbsp;
They are tares among the wheat.&nbsp; Jesus may be in their
mouths, penitence and pardon their prayers, but their practice is
that of Satan!</p>
<p>The <i>Reverend</i> John Church is pleased to charge the
present Publishers with &ldquo;the revival of <i>old tales</i>,
printed about five years ago;&rdquo; and, really, it is much to
be apprehended <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>that &ldquo;The Rod in Pickle,&rdquo; now presented to
the religious world, will refresh his memory not most agreeably
as to circumstances which he himself would willingly have buried
in the silence of the grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly&rdquo; as he
avows himself &ldquo;amenable to the laws,&rdquo; we much doubt
whether he would willingly have the details now published in due
form, submitted to a jury of his countrymen.&nbsp; Some
&ldquo;two false boys&rdquo; might happen to make out a serious
case against him, as one lad lately has done.</p>
<p>Whatever were the circumstances of Church&rsquo;s early life,
they certainly are of small moment in this question.&nbsp; Did he
not, after he coaxed them to become his bedfellows, at sundry
times, continue to &ldquo;suppose that he was in his own bed with
his wife,&rdquo; and behave to &ldquo;boys&rdquo; as though he
mistook them for his wife?&nbsp; Uxorious gentleman!</p>
<p>If, however, the reverend John Church could not travel without
his &ldquo;better half,&rdquo; why was not the poor woman his
helpmate at every stage of his preaching life?&nbsp; Besides, in
the absence of her, one should have thought, considering
circumstances, that his attention would have been paid rather to
females than to males.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more disgusting to a well-constituted
mind&mdash;abating its sinfulness&mdash;than the presumption with
which the reverend John Church relies on religion for his
salvation.&nbsp; No one is to cast a stone at him.&nbsp; Charged
as he undeniably stands with transactions the most unnatural and
foul&mdash;charged and convicted!&mdash;still, forsooth, he, and
only he, is in the tenderness of mercy to be spared.</p>
<p>And how, after all, does he get out of the Vere Street
scrape?&nbsp; Simply by asserting that there are &ldquo;ten
lies&rdquo; in the paragraph which accuses him, and that it is
scarcely worth his while to notice them, though those very lies
had blasted his character.&nbsp; Would any plain honest man have
endured such an imputation for half an hour?&nbsp; Even since the
year 1808, at least, this miserable preacher has been detected of
that sex-abusing crime for which language does not furnish <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>an
epithet.&nbsp; His sin has finally found him out, and it will be
impossible for him to escape the penalty due to it.</p>
<p>Banbury!&mdash;The reverend John Church has just denied that
he was &ldquo;driven out from thence;&rdquo; but what will he say
now, when &ldquo;The Rod in Pickle&rdquo; is twitching his hide,
and making him writhe at every stroke?&nbsp; Although, from
feelings of pity and mingled shame, the Congregation at Banbury
would &ldquo;not pretend to charge Mr. Church with having
actually, and in the full extent of the thing,&rdquo; anno 1808,
&ldquo;been guilty of the odious offence laid to his
charge,&rdquo; yet, &ldquo;from the whole tenor of his conduct,
his letters, and various things that appear in evidence,&rdquo;
they declared they were then &ldquo;constrained to believe that
he had discovered a most detestable propensity that way,&rdquo;
adding, that &ldquo;such was the abhorrence in which the crime he
was accused of was held by the people in Banbury, that, was he to
presume to return there, neither his person nor the Meeting would
be in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Church will, we are aware, try to overwhelm us with
antinomian <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> bulls; but as his faith is not likely to
remove <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>mountains, though it may raise some, we are content to
bear the entire weight of woe.&nbsp; Conscious that we shall have
fulfilled our duty to man&mdash;doubtless to woman&mdash;we shall
lie down content.&nbsp; We commisserate &ldquo;poor human
nature,&rdquo; quite as deeply as the reverend Mr. Church, but,
then, our pity is limited to natural sins.&nbsp; Offences of
another description we confess we cannot consent to
tolerate.&nbsp; This avowal may seem somewhat harsh to such
persons as the Reverend John Church, but we cannot help making
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abusers of themselves!&rdquo;&mdash;Has the
reverend John Church forgotten what awaits such men?</p>

7</span>AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
<i>Cause of Mr. Church Leaving Banbury</i>,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN OXFORDSHIRE.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">BY THE REV. T. LATHAM,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the month of August, 1808,
application was made to me by two Ministers in London, to supply
the place of John Church, at Banbury, without being informed of
the reason of his so suddenly leaving.&nbsp; As I was an entire
stranger to Mr. Church and the people at Banbury, I had no reason
to inquire, or suppose that any thing unpleasant had
occurred.&nbsp; However, about the middle of the week after my
first Sabbath there, Mr. Lambart, the acting Deacon of the
Church, brought me a letter, directed to his care for me, from
Mr. Garrett, of Lant-street Meeting, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> in which he mentioned
the steps Mr. Church was taking to get into Chapel-court Meeting,
to the injury of Mr. Nivin, the Minister of that place, and also
to the prejudice of himself, Mr. Garrett.&nbsp; In this letter
Mr. Barrett hinted at the cause of Mr. Church&rsquo;s leaving
Banbury, and earnestly wished me to send him and Mr. Nivin the
particulars.</p>
<p>After shewing the letter to Mr. Lambart and Mr. Hall, I asked
their counsel on the business (being a stranger to the whole
affair) who advised me to take the letter to some of the
principal-persons of the meeting; accordingly I went with them to
Mr. J. Gardenner and others, to whom Mr. Garrett&rsquo;s letter
was shown, when it appeared that several letters of inquiry had
been sent them from different persons <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>in London, but they from delicacy had
declined giving any answer; however, they now determined that a
Meeting should be held of the principal persons belonging to the
congregation. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; I did not attend that Meeting;
however, the day following, I was informed that they had
concluded to draw up an impartial statement of the whole matter,
and send it with copies of all the letters that had passed
between them and Mr. Church; I was requested to transcribe a
correct copy of the whole, which I did, and from that copy the
following extracts were impartially made:&mdash;</p>
<p>It appears that Mr. Church, while at Banbury, was very popular
as a preacher; he seemed fond of preaching at many places round
the neighbourhood, and was always well received: among other
places, he was in the habit of preaching at Kingham, at which
place he was held in very high esteem, and had many marks of the
peoples&rsquo; favour.&nbsp; He had made an engagement to go to
Birmingham; but a few days before he set off for that place, Mr.
T. Gardenner also received a letter, from a gentleman at Kingham,
at whose house Mr. Church was usually entertained, directed for
Mr. Church, requesting that it should be delivered into his own
hand and to no other person.&nbsp; Mr. T. Gardenner accordingly
waited on him, and put it into his hand; on opening it he changed
countenance; on reading further he became quite confused, and
appeared very much agitated and alarmed, but endeavoured to
conceal it as much as possible.&nbsp; Mr. Gardenner perceiving
this, requested an explanation.&nbsp; This he obtained by Church
shewing him the contents of the letter: this letter, it seems,
reprimanded his indelicate conduct towards two boys in the
family, the gentleman&rsquo;s son and a servant boy, who had
both, at his request, been his bed-fellows in their turns; and
finally it forbid his coming to preach at Kingham again.&nbsp;
Mr. Gardenner, thunder-struck at this, entreated him to <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>go directly to
Kingham and clear up the point, which Church said had no
foundation but in the falsehood and malice of the boys; but
Church declined going, alleging that it was of little consequence
what two false boys would say, and that his going to Kingham
would derange his plan of going to Birmingham, and that by the
time he returned the rumour would be done away.&nbsp; Mr.
Gardenner thought otherwise, and used every argument to prevail
on him to go, offering to accompany him with other friends to
clear him if possible, before the report got farther
abroad.&mdash;However, he still <i>refused going with his
friends</i>, but promised to call and settle the business himself
as he went to Birmingham.&nbsp; This he did not do, but took his
journey to Birmingham, leaving all in the greatest confusion
among his friends at Kingham and Banbury.&nbsp; The report
quickly spread, and such was the popular indignation, that it was
found necessary to keep the Meeting-house shut up, as both that
and the persons who had attended it were in danger, from the
insults of the enraged people of the town; the people were hooted
and shouted at in the streets, and branded with the opprobrious
name of S&mdash;m&mdash;s; the same was written upon the doors,
walls, and window-shutters of the place of worship, and fears
were entertained that the Chapel would have been burnt or pulled
down.&nbsp; Messrs. J. and T. Gardenner now went over to Kingham
to investigate the whole affair, the particulars of which are as
follows:&mdash;It appeared that whenever Church had occasion to
sleep from home he always wished to have a man or boy to sleep
with him.&nbsp; At Kingham he sometimes slept with the son of a
gentleman, who always made him welcome to his house when at that
place, whom he used to clasp round the neck, after preaching, and
say to him, &ldquo;<i>Come</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>you must be my
bed-fellow to-night</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the son at length
refusing to be his bed-fellow, he had the servant boy in his
place, for as yet nothing was suspected; at length both of them
refused sleeping with Mr. Church; and when the reason <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>was demanded,
the son said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to deep with Mr. Church,
because he always &mdash; on me in bed;&rdquo; the boy said
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sleeping with Mr. Church, because he
&mdash; me so much.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this rustic and simple
statement of the boys the inference was easily drawn; and as the
boys at every examination told the same tale, both when examined
by the gentleman of the house, by Messrs. Gardenners&rsquo;, and
also from Mr. Church&rsquo;s refusing to go to Kingham, and from
many things that now came out in different quarters, as well as
from many things in Mr. Church&rsquo;s letter, no doubt remained
but that he had acted imprudently and indelicately, to speak in
no more glaring terms; and the people at Banbury thought they
were fully justified in disowning him for their Minister, and all
the neighbourhood was of the same opinion.</p>
<p>It was now called to mind at other places where Mr. Church was
in the habit of sleeping, though some of them not so distant from
home but that he might have returned with ease after preaching,
that he has invariably wanted a bed-fellow, and it is affirmed
that he has gone to seek for a farmer&rsquo;s boy, or any one he
could get, and apologised for bringing in a bed-fellow, by saying
he was apt to be troubled with a lowness of spirits in the night
after the fatigue of walking and preaching, and that he always
preferred a bed-fellow for company in the night: he was also in
the habit of taking a person of very low character with him from
Banbury to be his bed-fellow; this person was a porter there, and
the people were at a loss for the cause of such intimacy.&nbsp;
However, when the reports began to spread, this person was
missing from Banbury, and was not heard of all the time I was
there, which was looked upon as a circumstance that indicated
nothing very favourable to Mr. Church.&nbsp; Another thing which
was also interpreted in an unfavourable light was, that Mr.
Church had made companions of several buckish young men in
Banbury, and had frequently amused himself with seeing them <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>naked,
washing in a river or pond, and that he had been in their company
at very unseasonable hours at night.&nbsp; There was also a young
man a hair dresser, apprentice to Mr. Hall, who attended Church
to dress and shave him, and when he was about this business,
Church used to take many indecent liberties with him.&nbsp; The
young man was much disgusted, but did not expose him till other
things came out.&nbsp; I was also informed by James Hall, grocer,
a young man of serious principles, and who was in connection with
Mr. Westley&rsquo;s people, that being at a public association,
at Warwick, if I recollect the place right, that having to stay
all night, Mr. Church was very importunate with him to take a
part of the bed which he had engaged, and would hardly admit of a
denial; and when Mr. Hall positively refused to be his
bed-fellow, Mr. Church appeared quite offended at his
refusal.</p>
<p>As soon as Messrs. T. and J. Gardenner returned from inquiring
into the affair at Kingham, and had reported the testimony of the
boys and others to the people at Banbury, it was concluded to
write to Church at Birmingham, and inform him of the result of
their inquiries, and to let him know they disowned him as their
Minister, desiring him at the same time not to return to Banbury
on any account.&nbsp; The letter he sent in answer to theirs was
made up of concessions and apologies, self-criminations and
excuses, half confessions, evasive retractions of those
confessions, and evidently showed his mind while writing it to be
much agitated.&nbsp; Some of his own words are: &ldquo;I have
done foolishly&mdash;I have acted most imprudently; O! how I have
wounded the dear cause of God at Banbury:&mdash;O! it breaks my
very heart to think how I have given the enemies of the blessed
Gospel cause to blaspheme on my account:&mdash;O! how I have
abused the kindness of the best of friends:&mdash;O! if it be
possible, don&rsquo;t let the cause be known of my being absent
from Banbury: you may say I am gone on a journey, and you will
speak the truth; but, oh! my dear friends, I must return to you
again; I cannot think of parting with you; do say that I may
return; I must, indeed I must, or I shall die with
grief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere he says, &ldquo;the boys tell a
<i>simple plain story</i>, and you do <i>right to believe
them</i> in what they say; and I own that I have been too
imprudent, <i>but I am not conscious of having done the actual
crime</i>; if any thing of that nature has been of which they
speak, it must have been without my knowledge, when I was asleep,
and supposing I was in my own bed with my wife; but I know of no
criminal intention or act, except in this way.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The letter
runs all in this strain, with frequent petitions to be permitted
to return, and almost insisting on that being granted.&nbsp; To
this he had an answer sent from the principals of the
congregation, in which, after treating the subject in a suitable
manner, they tell him:&mdash;&ldquo;You must not by any means or
on any account whatever think of returning to Banbury, for we
assure you that such is the abhorrence in which the crime you are
accused of, is held by the people in Banbury, that were you to
presume to come, neither your person nor the Meeting would be in
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this a letter was received from Mr. Burton, of Warwick,
stating, that he had at last prevailed upon Church to accompany
him to Kingham, and that he had examined the boys before Church,
who told the same story as before, when all that he offered as an
excuse was, that &ldquo;it was possible for such things to have
happened when he was asleep;&rdquo; and that Church appeared to
him deeply sensible of and humble for his imprudent
conduct.&nbsp; What Church wished to be understood by imprudent
conduct was this, he is afflicted with a rupture, and grants that
he had asked his bed-fellows either to look at or feel the
difference of the rupture at night after preaching and in the
morning after a night&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp; About the same time
that Mr. Burton wrote to Banbury, as mentioned above, Church also
wrote, and in this letter he acknowledges that the boys kept to
their story in his presence, but excuses himself as
before&mdash;that what passed was when he was asleep, and that
the boys owned to him that they neither of them spoke a word to
him at the time those things happened.&nbsp; He also owns that he
had been carried too much away with the vain desire of
popularity, and lifted up with pride by the caresses of the
people, and that the Lord had suffered this trial to befal him to
humble him and empty him of self; that he now saw and lamented
his folly; he acknowledges that he had been too gay and trifling,
and too fond of young, light, and trifling company, with a great
deal more self-crimination; then he proceeds to draw up a long
set of rules for his future conduct, and promises, if restored to
Banbury, to forsake the company of the young, and associate with
the aged and grave&mdash;to revere their counsel and
advice&mdash;to receive kindly their seasonable admonitions and
rebukes&mdash;to give up the pursuit of popularity&mdash;to be
content at home among his own people&mdash;to abandon all village
preaching, and never again to sleep out of his own bed, nor away
from his wife&mdash;and, in short, to change his conduct all
through.&nbsp; He also tells them how much he feels interested in
their welfare, and proposes to send them a supply <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>for a season;
but begs them, for God&rsquo;s sake, <i>not to let the real cause
of his expulsion be made known</i>.&nbsp; In concluding he hopes
that his confessions, promises of amendment, and professions of
repentance will, at length, restore him to Banbury.</p>
<p>The last letter Mr. Church wrote to Banbury, from Birmingham,
was to arrange some matters about his family following him up to
London; and appears to have been written in great hurry and
confusion.&nbsp; I have made but one extract from that, which is
as follows:&mdash;He says to Mr. T. Gardenner, to whom he wrote,
&ldquo;They have been, (alluding, I suppose, to some persons from
Kingham, having been at Warwick) and brought the accounts hither,
and have set all the people in such confusion about me, so that a
dear <i>friend of mine</i>, <i>who was apprehensive</i> for my
personal safety, set off from thence, late as it was, and arrived
here (Birmingham) at a very late hour, and his coming has thrown
the whole family where I am into such confusion and disorder,
that it was judged prudent for me to leave the town immediately,
which I shall do accordingly, without delay.&nbsp; Look after my
wife and the dear children, send her up by the first coach to
London; she knows where to find me in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall now give some account of the proceedings of the people
at Banbury, as to drawing up the statement to be sent up to
London, and the reason why it was kept back, after it was drawn
up and written out by me, at the request of the people
there.&nbsp; In the first place, every letter was copied
verbatim, in the regular order in which they had passed between
Mr. Church and them.&nbsp; To these was annexed a preliminary
address, in the name of the principals of the congregation; the
particulars already mentioned were stated, the various charges
alledged, and then the conclusion they drew from the whole, which
was couched in the following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;We do not
pretend to charge Mr. Church with having actually, and in the
full extent of the thing, been guilty of the odious offence laid
to his charge; but from the whole tenure of his conduct, his
letters, and the various things that appear in evidence, we are
constrained to believe, that he has discovered a most detestable
propensity that way; and if what you receive in these documents
are not sufficient proof to you of the same; if you choose to be
at the expense of it, we can send you up a whole coach load of
living witnesses to the same facts.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus far the
business had proceeded: all the papers were drawn up in order,
and it only remained for them to be properly signed by the
parties who <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>were principally concerned in the investigation,
particularly by the deacons of the church; in order to this they
were read at a meeting of those parties, and generally
approved.&nbsp; Messrs. J. and T. Gardenners, actually and
readily signed their names to them; but Mr. Lambart, the acting
deacon, positively refused to give his signature, and without it
they could not be properly considered as the Churches act.&nbsp;
At this, the other parties were very much displeased, but could
not prevail on Mr. Lambart, by any means, to sign his name.&nbsp;
The reason he alledged for not doing it was this, Mr. Church was
indebted to him sixteen or seventeen pounds, and he said, that if
those papers appeared in London against him, his friends there
must all forsake him; and then he, Mr. Lambart, must loose his
money, which he could not afford to do; and, therefore, until he
had got that he would sign nothing against him; though, when he
had got his money he did not care if Church was hanged; this much
I heard Mr. Lambart assert.&nbsp; This caused a demur, and though
the other parties all wished the papers to go, they could not
without Mr. Lambart&rsquo;s name, for the reason mentioned
above.&nbsp; After some deliberations and consultations, it was
represented by some, that they were likely to get into a deal of
trouble if those papers were sent to London: that if Mr. Church
was taken into custody, and had to undergo an examination, that
they should have to attend as witnesses; and as they could not
foresee all the inconveniences that might ensue both to
themselves and also to Church; and as they had now done with him
as their Minister, they finally agreed to suppress the papers,
and leave him to get on in London in the best manner he
could.</p>
<p>After my engagement at Banbury was fulfilled, I returned home;
but when arrived in London, before the coach reached the inn at
which it was to stop, a person called to the coachman, and
inquired for my name; the coachman stopped and asked, if any
passenger in the coach answered to that name: I answered, and was
requested by the unknown person to accompany him to
James&rsquo;s-street, Covent-garden, where the congregation and
minister were waiting for me, and would not proceed until I
arrived.&nbsp; This appeared singular to me, but, guessing the
reason, I went with him to the place.&nbsp; As soon as I arrived
the service went on, and at the close of the sermon, the preacher
addressed the people; and, pointing to me, told them that I was
just come up from Banbury, where I had been a month with the
people that Mr. Church had left, and that from me they might have
a true account of what had passed.&nbsp; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Then he spoke
to me: &ldquo;Do, dear brother, stand up and tell the people what
you know about this affair;&rdquo; and, having thus spoke, sat
him down.&nbsp; All eyes were now on me, and I was obliged to
rise and say something: I told the people I found myself
awkwardly situated&mdash;just come from the coach&mdash;my
thoughts uncollected on the subject&mdash;and an entire stranger
both to them and Mr. Church, whom I had never seen; I wished to
speak with caution&mdash;though I must confess that at Banbury
there were reports in circulation very unfavourable to him, and
proofs of his having acted with imprudence and
indiscretion.&nbsp; I then mentioned what was said by the boys at
Kingham, and begged to be excused from saying more.&nbsp; The
Minister then made a very warm harrangue to the people at some
length, and so the business terminated at that time.</p>
<p>The next evening I preached at a certain place in London, and
after sermon the two Deacons of the place requested me to attend
them to Rehoboath Chapel, where I was again interrogated by a Mr.
White and another Minister.&nbsp; I told them some particulars
which they seemed to get over very well.&nbsp; They then shewed
me a letter, and asked me if I knew the hand writing, which I
did.&nbsp; Strange as it may appear, this letter was from a
person who was present at the meeting at Banbury, before
mentioned, in answer to one they had wrote to him, in which he
exonerated Mr. Church from every thing but a little imprudence in
getting into debt, saying he was a good preacher, a good father,
and a good husband, and adds, when you see him give my kind love
to him.</p>
<p>Some months after this, when Mr. Church was at Chapel Court
Meeting, I accepted of an invitation to take tea with Mr. Harper,
proprietor of that Meeting.&nbsp; Mr. Niven went with me; upon
Mr. Harper expressing a wish to be informed of every particular
relative to the Banbury business, I said but little then; but
observed that I should not have the least objection provided Mr.
Church was present.&nbsp; This was agreed to, and a meeting was
held in the vestry of Chapel-court Meeting.&nbsp; Here, for the
first time, I saw Mr. Church.&nbsp; Mr. Love, Mr. Niven, Mr.
Harper, Mr. Burbridge, and some others were present.&nbsp; Mr.
Church and I were total strangers to each other; but in the
presence of the meeting, I stated every particular that I have
written in these pages; and the parties present all listened to
the account.&nbsp; When I had done, I asked Mr. Church if I had
done him any wrong?&nbsp; He said, he believed I had given a true
statement; he also acknowledged the quotations from his letters
to be correct.&nbsp; After this I heard him preach two <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>evening
Lectures in Chapel-court, and spoke to him and Mr. Burbridge, and
this is all the acquaintance I ever had with him.&nbsp; I thought
proper to mention these things in the presence of Mr. Church,
that all who read this (now made public) may be assured they have
a correct account of nothing more than what Mr. Church has
acknowledged correct before so many witnesses.&nbsp; And I
considered it needful to state my very slight knowledge of him,
because some persons account of my being so often called upon to
speak about him, have tried to make it out that I was an intimate
acquaintance of his.&nbsp; But I hope that is sufficiently proved
to be a false representation.&nbsp; I have made no comment on any
part of the subject, nor do I intend to make any: every person
must read and think for himself, and put that construction on the
whole that appears most natural to him.&nbsp; Some will, perhaps,
say why did you never make these things public before?&nbsp; I
answer because I did not till now see it proper.&nbsp; And others
will say, why keep the secret so long, and now divulge it after
all?&nbsp; I answer, such I kept it while I thought it right to
do so, and make it public for the satisfaction of those who wish
to know both the beginning and conclusion of the whole
matter.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#citation5"
class="footnote">[5]</a>&nbsp; We are informed that Church
belongs to that sect called <span
class="smcap">Antinomians</span>, which is that described by the
Rev. John Evans in his &ldquo;Sketch of the Denominations of the
Christian World&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Antinomian derives his name from <span
class="smcap">Anti</span> and <span class="smcap">Nomos</span>;
signifying, against, and a law, his favourite tenet being, that
the law is not a rule of life to believers.&nbsp; It is not easy
to ascertain what he means by this position, but he seems to
carry the doctrine of imputed righteousness of Christ and
salvation by faith without works to such lengths as to injure, if
not wholly destroy the obligation to moral obedience.&nbsp;
Antinomianism may be traced to the period of the reformation, and
its promulgator was John Agricola, originally a disciple of
Luther.&nbsp; The Papists in their disputes with the Protestants
of that day carried the merit of good works to an extravagant
length; and this induced some of their opponents to run into the
opposite extreme.&nbsp; &ldquo;This sect (say the Encyclopedia)
sprung up in England during the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell,
and extended the system of libertinism much farther than
Agricola, the disciple of Luther.&nbsp; Some of their teachers
expressly maintained, that as the elect cannot fall from grace
nor forfeit the divine favour, the wicked actions they commit are
not really sinful, nor are they to be considered as instances of
their violation of the Divine Law; consequently they have no
occasion to confess their sins, or to break them off by
repentance.&nbsp; According to them it was one of the essential
and distinctive characters of the elect that they cannot do any
thing displeasing to God, or prohibited by Law.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
